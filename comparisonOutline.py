This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d = ("sarah" == "bloch")
print(d)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d = (4 == 4)
print(d)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d = (3 < 2)
print(d)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d = (2 < 3)
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 5
x = 3
g = (x >= y)
print(g)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 5
x = 3
g = (y <= x)
print(g)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
d = (3 < )
